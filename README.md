# ObservePoint GitHub Actions Integration

A GitHub Action that seamlessly integrates ObservePoint audits into your CI/CD pipeline, automatically triggering audits and handling results through callback workflows.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Audit Execution**: Trigger ObservePoint audits directly from your GitHub workflows
- **Secure Integration**: Uses encrypted secrets and fine-grained permissions
- **Callback Support**: Automatically triggers follow-up workflows when audits complete via `repository_dispatch` event
- **Low Cost**: ObservePoint's `run_observepoint_audit` action does not wait for an audit run to complete, so you do not pay for waiting
- **PR Integration**: Works seamlessly with pull request workflows
- **Organization Whitelisting**: Secure access control through pre-approved GitHub organizations

## 🔄 How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant GH as Your Workflow
    participant OP as ObservePoint
    participant OPGH as ObservePoint GitHub App
    participant CB as Your Callback Workflow

    GH->>OP: 1. Trigger audit with API key
    OP->>OP: 2. Execute audit
    OP->>OPGH: 3. Audit complete notification
    OPGH->>CB: 4. repository_dispatch when complete
    CB->>CB: 5. Process results & notify
```

1. **Trigger Audit**: GitHub Action calls ObservePoint API with your audit configuration
2. **Execute Audit**: ObservePoint runs the specified audit on your URLs
3. **Audit Complete Notification**: ObservePoint notifies the ObservePoint GitHub App upon completion
4. **Repository Dispatch**: The ObservePoint GitHub App triggers your callback workflow via GitHub repository dispatch event
5. **Process Results**: Your callback workflow handles the results and can notify your team

### ⚠️ **Important**: To ensure proper access control, customers must contact ObservePoint customer support to provide their GitHub organization name for whitelisting before using this integration.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- [ ] Active ObservePoint account with ObservePoint API key
- [ ] GitHub organization whitelisted with ObservePoint (see Step 1 in "Setup & Configuration" section below)
- [ ] ObservePoint Audit ID - found in the URL of your audit's page
- [ ] GitHub repository with [ObservePoint GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/observepoint-integration) installed and GitHub Actions enabled
- [ ] Repository admin access for secrets management

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Configuration

### Step 1: Whitelist Your GitHub Organization

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before using this integration, your GitHub organization must be whitelisted by ObservePoint.

1. Contact your ObservePoint customer support team
2. Provide your **exact GitHub organization name** (case-sensitive)
    - Find this in your repository URL: `https://github.com/{ORGANIZATION_NAME}/repo-name`
    - Example: For `https://github.com/acme-corp/my-repo`, the organization name is `acme-corp`
3. Request GitHub Actions integration enablement
4. Wait for confirmation that your organization has been whitelisted

💡 **Note**: This is a one-time setup per organization. All repositories within the whitelisted organization will have access to the integration.

### Step 2: Get Your ObservePoint API Key

1. Log in to ObservePoint
2. Open "Profile & Permissions"
3. Generate a new key or copy an existing one

💡 **Note**: You can create a dedicated non-admin user in ObservePoint, and use its key for this integraiton.

### Step 3: Find Your Audit ID

1. Log in to ObservePoint
2. Navigate to your desired audit
3. The Audit ID is in the URL: `https://app.observepoint.com/audits/{AUDIT_ID}`

### Step 4: Install ObservePoint GitHub App

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The integration requires the ObservePoint GitHub App to be installed in your organization.

Link to ObservePoint GitHub App: https://github.com/apps/observepoint-integration

1. Your organization admin will need to install the ObservePoint GitHub App with the following permissions:
   - **Repository access**: Select the repositories that will use the integration
   - **Repository permissions**:
      - **Contents**: Read and Write ✓
      - **Metadata**: Read ✓
2. Wait for confirmation that the GitHub App has been installed and configured

ℹ️ The ObservePoint GitHub App uses `repository_dispatch` to trigger callback workflows, which requires **Contents: Read and Write** permissions for proper functionality.

### Step 5: Configure GitHub Secrets

Store your ObservePoint API key securely in your repository:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the **Settings** tab (located at the top of your repository page)
3. In the left sidebar, scroll down to **Security** section
4. Click **Secrets and variables**
5. Select **Actions** from the dropdown menu
6. You'll see the **Repository secrets** section
7. Click the **New repository secret** button
8. Configure the secret:
    - **Name**: Enter `OBSERVEPOINT_API_KEY` (exactly as shown, case-sensitive)
    - **Secret**: Paste your ObservePoint API key value
9. Click **Add secret** to save

💡 **Note**: Repository secrets are encrypted and only accessible to workflows running in your repository. The ObservePoint API key will be masked in workflow logs for security.

## 🔧 Implementation

### Primary Workflow Job

This is the workflow triggered in every run of your CI/CD pipeline to start an ObservePoint audit.

Add this job (or replace the legacy one) in your pipeline, e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
jobs:
  # … your existing jobs …

    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: ObservePoint-Start-Audit
        uses: observepoint/github-actions-integration@v1.0.0
        with:
          audit_id: 'YOUR_AUDIT_ID'
          starting_urls: 'https://example.com/,https://api.example.com/'
          observepoint_api_key: ${{ secrets.observepoint_api_key }}
          callback_owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          callback_repo:  ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
          callback_event_type: 'observepoint-audit-complete'
          callback_ref:   'main'
          pr_number:      ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          commit_sha:     ${{ github.sha }}
          # Optional user data merged into callbackContext
          callback_context_json: >
            {

### Callback Workflow

This workflow will be triggered when the ObservePoint audit completes. It processes the results and can fail the build if alerts are detected.

Create a file like `.github/workflows/audit-complete.yml` to handle audit completion via repository dispatch:

```yaml
name: Audit Complete Handler

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [observepoint-audit-complete]

jobs:
  process_results:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Process audit results
        run: |
          echo "🔍 Processing audit completion…"
          echo "Audit ID:         ${{ github.event.client_payload.audit_id }}"
          echo "Run ID:           ${{ github.event.client_payload.run_id }}"
          echo "Alerts Triggered: ${{ github.event.client_payload.alerts_triggered }}"
          echo "UI Link:          ${{ github.event.client_payload.audit_run_ui_link }}"
          echo "Context JSON:     ${{ toJson(github.event.client_payload.context) }}"

      - name: Fail build on alerts
        run: |
          if [ "${{ github.event.client_payload.alerts_triggered }}" -gt 0 ]; then
            echo "❌ Audit failed – alerts detected"
            exit 1
          else
            echo "✅ Audit passed – no alerts"
          fi
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Organization not whitelisted:**
- Ensure your GitHub organization has been whitelisted by ObservePoint support
- Verify you provided the exact organization name (case-sensitive)
- Check that the API call is coming from a repository within the whitelisted organization

**Audit not triggering:**
- Verify your `OBSERVEPOINT_API_KEY` secret is correctly set
- Check that the audit ID exists and is accessible with your ObservePoint API key
- Ensure your organization is whitelisted (see above)

**Callback not working:**
- Ensure the ObservePoint GitHub App has been installed in your organization
- Verify the ObservePoint GitHub App has `Contents: Read and Write` and `Metadata: Read` permissions
- Check that the callback workflow file exists and listens for the correct `repository_dispatch` event type
- Ensure the event type in your callback workflow matches the `callback_event_type` parameter

**Workflow fails:**
- Review GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
- Verify all required parameters are provided
- Ensure the repository has Actions enabled
- Check that client payload data is being accessed correctly using `github.event.client_payload`
